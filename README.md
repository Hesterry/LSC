### LSC is now essentially complete, and I will be setting the project aside. However, development will hopefully continue in someone else's hands. For more details, please see this page: https://github.com/Hesterry/LSC/wiki/The-Future-of-LSC


### What is LSC?

LSC is a highly sophisticated, but easy to use, life skill profit calculator for Black Desert Online. By using a set of human-readable databases, it can determine the profit of hundreds of crafts in an instant, making it easy to figure out what is worth crafting.  

For more information, check out the Wiki page here: https://github.com/Hesterry/LSC/wiki  


### Installing

Installing is easy, because nothing needs to be installed. Simply download LSC, unzip it somewhere with unrestricted read/write permissions (like your Desktop), and run LSC.exe. If this is your first time using LSC, you will be prompted to do some basic setup. I also recommend taking a look at the "LSC_User_Guide.pdf" packaged with LSC for help getting started.  


### Updating

If you're updating LSC from an older version, all you really need to do is copy over your databases, then run LSC's database updater. Open up your old LSC folder, open up the LSC subfolder, and you should see at least one ".csv" file. Copy these files to the same place in the new LSC folder.  

**Do not try to merge one LSC folder into the other! Despite what GitHub may imply, this will not work!**  

Next, run LSC. If there have been any changes to the databases, a "DB Update Configuration" window will appear. It is highly recommended that you update *everything*, unless you're sure of what you're doing.

**If you accidentally skip an update, you can always run the DB updater again from the main menu, under "Show Database Control".**


### Uninstalling

Delete the LSC folder, then navigate to C:\Users\\"UserName"\AppData\Local\ and delete the LSC folder to erase LSC's settings.  


### Donate

LSC's development is currently on hold, so I've removed the Patreon link within the app, and I'm no longer including donation links in my posts to Reddit and the BDO forums. However, if you still wish to donate to show support for my past effort, I've decided to leave these links here in the ReadMe. Thank you!

Last but certainly not least, a special thanks to my early testers, Eddit and Ryalin of Espers. You two made an incredible difference in the overall quality and development speed of LSC. Also, a big thanks to those of you who picked up LSC early, joined the Discord, and gave me your much needed feedback. Thank you, everyone :)
